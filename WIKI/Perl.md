 After I rebuilt Perl 5.20 appeared a problem, install it removes many dependencies built with the old Perl (even draktools and easy-rpmbuild) and these last require to rebuild for the new Perl. I found on google-search Perlbrew. It allows you to use multiple perl, they are installed in home without interfering with pre-existing Perl.
