# **1. Introduction:**

Md5sum and sha...sum apps are used for obtain a number as a result of summation or execution of other mathematical operations
and are used to validate the processed data.

Benefits:
- Reduces the risk of file downloads with errors.
- If the master file and the verification file are on two different servers, 
 verification allows you to check if the file has been swapped. ( of course not always )
 Additionally you can upload for example sha256sum file on two different websites.
A user who knows both websites, can download and compare two files.

Defect:
- It is very difficult generate the same shortcut for two different files,
but for all such algorithms, theoretically there are an unlimited number of files that will have the same ( md, sha ) shortcut and this is a defect.
This case is called a collision and for now was found way create an identical shortcut in MD5, SHA-0, SHA-1.
**Therefore, these algorithms ( MD5, SHA-0, SHA-1) are not recommended to use.**

# **2. Create md5 file:**
More about MD5 in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Md5sum

```
md5sum file > file.md5
```

Example:
```
$ md5sum uplos-mate-2017-03-15-en.iso > uplos-mate-2017-03-15-en.iso.md5
```


# **3. Check md5 file:**

Put **file** and **file.md5** in the same place, then
```
md5sum -c file.md5
```

Example:
```
$ md5sum -c uplos-mate-2017-03-15-en.iso.md5
uplos-mate-2017-03-15-en.iso: OK
```

**This indicates a proper sum of control.**


================================
**Possible errors:**
```
$ md5sum -c uplos-mate-2017-03-15-en.iso.md5
md5sum: uplos-mate-2017-03-15-en.iso.md5: no properly formatted MD5 checksum lines found
```

- Check file *.md5 , there should be two spaces.
- Check command inside system, when you have error and only one space inside file, after download.
```
echo $LANG
```
Output not should be empty.
================================


# **4. SHA ( Secure Hash Algorithms ) **
More in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Hash_Algorithms

Similarly like above md5 file we will create sha file:
- for SHA1
```
$ sha1sum uplos-mate-2017-03-15-en.iso > uplos-mate-2017-03-15-en.iso.sha1
```
- for SHA2
```
$ sha256sum uplos-mate-2017-03-15-en.iso > uplos-mate-2017-03-15-en.iso.sha256
```

And similarly we will check:
- for SHA1
```
$ sha1sum -c uplos-mate-2017-03-15-en.iso.sha1
uplos-mate-2017-03-15-en.iso: OK
```
- for SHA2
```
$ sha256sum -c uplos-mate-2017-03-15-en.iso.sha256
uplos-mate-2017-03-15-en.iso: OK
```
