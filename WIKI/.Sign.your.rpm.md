Ok this is the base, open a terminale and give 'gpg --gen-key'. You are ask to write your real name, for ex. Adriano Morselli, a comment (your nickname for ex adrianomorselli) and your email for ex blablabla@email.com. You are asked for a passphrase, use a simple phrase and remember it!
After from terminal give
gpg --export -a 'Adriano Morselli' > RPM-GPG-KEY-adrianomorselli
become root with su and type
rpm --import RPM-GPG-KEY-adrianomorselli
exit
Configure your .rpmmacros in your home adding
%_signature gpg
%_gpg_path /home/your_user/.gnupg
%_gpg_name Adriano Morselli
%_gpgbin /usr/bin/gpg
Save and exit
Now to add sign to your rpm and src.rpm open a terminal where you have your file spec and type
rpmbuild -ba --sign file.spec
Type your pass phrase and voil√†. To check open a terminal where is your rpm (or src.rpm) and type
rpm --checksig file.rpm
Is it all ok? Good! 


By the way if your system crash make before a copy of these files:
- RPM-GPG-KEYS-your_nickname
- .rpmmacros
- .gnupg (all folder)
I did a tar folder and send to me by email so it is available. Have you a new installation? No problem, copy all file in your home. Your sign is safety 


Sometimes you need check to know. ( check, should work )
