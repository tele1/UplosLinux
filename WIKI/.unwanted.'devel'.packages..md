In case the developers have too many 'devel' packages Wink

Create file with this command:

Code:
rpm -qa | grep devel | sort -f | sed -e "s/devel/*^/" | cut -d "^" -f1 | sed -e "s/*/devel/" | sed -e "{s/glibc-devel//g;s/glibc-headers-devel//g;s/kernel-devel//g;s/lib64ncurses-devel//g;s/libstdc++-devel//g;s/lib64python-devel//g}" | paste -d" " -s  > develfiles.txt

Then remove (as root):

Code:
apt-get remove `cat develfiles.txt`

This command will show you all the 'devel' packages that will
be removed from your system, if your happy confirm with 'Yes'.

This is from 'Daniel' the german pclinuxos member/moderator/packager.

Note: some devel packages will NOT get deleted: glibc, libstdc++ etc, because every
system needs these !!

Hope it's helpful.
